    <p>Another pride and joy of the City of Buffalo is Buffalo wings, serve with blue cheese dressing for the best experience!</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>2 lb. chicken wings</li>
<li>2 tbsp. Vegetable oil
</li>
<li>1 tsp. garlic powder
</li>
<li>Kosher salt
</li>
<li>Freshly ground black pepper
</li>
<li>1/4 c. hot sauce (such as Frank's)
</li>
<li>2 tbsp. honey
</li>
<li>4 tbsp. butter
</li>
<li>Blue cheese dressing, for serving
</li>
<li>Carrot sticks, for serving
</li>
<li>Celery sticks, for serving
</li>

</ul>


<h3>Directions</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 400° and place a wire rack over a baking sheet. In a large bowl, toss chicken wings with oil and season with garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Transfer to prepared baking sheet.</li>
    <li>Bake until chicken is golden and skin is crispy, 50 to 60 minutes, flipping the wings halfway through.
    </li>
    <li>In a small saucepan, whisk together hot sauce and honey. Bring to simmer then stir in butter. Cook until butter is melted and slightly reduced, about 2 minutes. Heat broiler on low. Transfer baked wings to a bowl and toss with buffalo sauce until completely coated. Return wings to rack and broil—watching carefully!—until sauce caramelizes, 3 minutes. Serve with ranch dressing and vegetables.
    </li>
    <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
